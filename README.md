- 👋 Hi, My name is Liam Bartsch.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  1. Solving Problems
  2. Helping people
  3. Public Good Regime
  4. Improving transactional relationships to become transformational ones.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Project that would be useful yet is blocked because no one is willing to help with no expecation of reward.
